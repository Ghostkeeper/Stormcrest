Cabinet
=======
The cabinet is meant to look like a treasure chest. Building it involves a bit of woodwork and metalwork and ageing the wood.

Preparation
-----------
First compile the file [cabinet.scad](../models/cabinet.scad) and print it out. In the echo stream in OpenSCAD you'll find the dimensions of the boards you need to cut, so write those down on the print-out. This will be handy when you're building the cabinet.

Materials
---------
For this part you'll need:
* 3x spruce plank 18x194x2700mm
* 250g ebony wood stain
* A corded drill
* A handsaw
* A brush for the wood stain

Ageing the Wood
---------------
1. Attach a bowl brush to your drill.
2. Sand all the wooden planks with the brush. The aim is to grind out the soft wood between the grains, but not the grains themselves. This creates a deep texture that will be enhanced further in the next steps.
3. Sand all the wooden planks with 120 grit sanding paper. Just a light touch to shine it up is enough.
4. Coat the wooden planks with wood stain.
5. Let the stain dry for 24 hours.
6. Sand only the top bits slightly.

Cutting the Boards
------------------
1. Cut one corner off a plank at a 10.34 degree angle as per the dimensions in [cabinet.scad](../models/cabinet.scad).
2. Measure a 1.30m length of plank and cut another 10.34 degree angle perpendicular to the length of the plank. This plank will be the top half of one of the sides.
3. Measure another 1.30m length and make a third cut at 10.34 degrees. This should be towards the end of the plank now, so there is only several centimetres of wood leftover in this plank.
